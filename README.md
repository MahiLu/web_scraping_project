# web_scraping_project

## Description

The purpose of this project is to understand the impact of Covid-19 on the perception of vaccinations. Three-time durations were selected: 
    •	The first was from February 2019 until April 2019 when Covid did not exist yet
    •	The second was from February 2020 until April 2020 when Covid first occurred and 
    •	The last one was from February 2021 until April 2021 when covid vaccinations were available to the public. 
    
The website Reddit was scrapped for comments mentioning the keywords:
“anti-vaccination”, “anti-vaccine”, and “anti-vax” during the corresponding time durations, and a comparison of how they have changed within those periods is performed. The resulting dataset consists of three files each containing the number of mentions of the chosen keywords during each period.

## Python libraries used in this project:
1. Regular expressions
2. Psaw
3. Datetime
4. Numpy
5. Statsmodels
6. Pandas

## Instructions
You need to install the python library packages listed above to do the analysis. The date ranges can be expanded. Note that the web scraping takes time proportional to the date ranges used.
The repository contains all the codes used for the analysis.
